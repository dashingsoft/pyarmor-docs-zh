What's Pyarmor
==============

|Pyarmor| is a command line tool used to obfuscate |Python| scripts, bind
obfuscated scripts to fixed machine or expire obfuscated scripts.

Key Features:

* The obfuscated scritpt is still a normal ``.py`` script, in most of cases the
  original python scripts can be replaced with obfuscated scripts seamlessly.
* Provide many options to obfuscate the scripts to balance security and performance
* Rename functions/methods/classes/variables/arguments, irreversible obfuscation
* Convert part of Python functions to C function, irreversible obfuscation
* Bind obfuscated scripts to fixed machine or expire obfuscted scripts
* Protect obfuscated scripts by Themida (Only for Windows)

Installation from PyPI
======================

Pyarmor_ packages are published on the PyPI_. The preferred tool for installing
packages from PyPI_ is :command:`pip`. This tool is provided with all modern
versions of Python.

On Linux or MacOS, you should open your terminal and run the following command::

    $ pip install -U pyarmor

On Windows, you should open Command Prompt (:kbd:`Win-r` and type
:command:`cmd`) and run the same command:

.. code-block:: doscon

    C:\> pip install -U pyarmor

After installation, type :command:`pyarmor --version` on the command prompt. If
everything worked fine, you will see the version number for the Pyarmor_ package
you just installed.

Obfuscating one script
======================

.. program:: pyarmor gen

Here it's the simplest command to obfuscate one script :file:`foo.py`::

    $ pyarmor gen foo.py

The command ``gen`` could be replaced with ``g`` or ``generate``::

    $ pyarmor g foo.py
    $ pyarmor generate foo.py

This command generates an obfuscated script :file:`dist/foo.py`, which is a
valid Python script, run it by Python interpreter::

    $ python dist/foo.py

Check all generated files in the default output path::

    $ ls dist/
    ...    foo.py
    ...    pyarmor_runtime_000000

There is an extra Python package :file:`pyarmor_runtime_000000`, which is
required to run the obfuscated script.

Distributing the obfuscated script
----------------------------------

Only copy :file:`dist/foo.py` to another machine doesn't work, instead copy
all the files in the :file:`dist/`.

Why? It's clear after checking the content of :file:`dist/foo.py`:

.. code-block:: python

    from pyarmor_runtime_000000 import __pyarmor__
    __pyarmor__(__name__, __file__, ...)

Actually the obfuscaetd script can be taken as normal Python script with
dependent package :mod:`pyarmor_runtime`, use it as it's not obfuscated.

.. note::

   The obfuscated scripts could be run by Python interpreter without
   Pyarmor, DO NOT install Pyarmor in the :term:`Target Device`

Obfuscating one package
=======================

Now let's do a package. :option:`-O` is used to set output path
:file:`dist2` different from the default::

    $ pyarmor gen -O dist2 src/mypkg

Check the output::

    $ ls dist2/
    ...    mypkg
    ...    pyarmor_runtime_000000

    $ ls dist2/mypkg/
    ...          __init__.py

All the obfuscated scripts in the :file:`dist2/mypkg`, test it::

    $ cd dist2/
    $ python -C 'import mypkg'

If there are sub-packages, using :option:`-r` to enable recursive mode::

    $ pyarmor gen -O dist2 -r src/mypkg

Distributing the obfuscated package
-----------------------------------

Also it works to copy the whole path :file:`dist2` to another machine. But
it's not convience, the better way is using :option:`-i` to generate all
the required files inside package path::

    $ pyarmor gen -O dist3 -r -i src/mypkg

Check the output::

    $ ls dist3/
    ...    mypkg

    $ ls dist3/mypkg/
    ...          __init__.py
    ...          pyarmor_runtime_000000

Now everything is in the package path :file:`dist3/mypkg`, just copy the
whole path to any target machine.

.. note::

   Comparing current :file:`dist3/mypkg/__init__.py` with above section
   :file:`dist2/mypkg/__init__.py` to understand more about obfuscated
   scripts

Expiring obfuscated scripts
===========================

It's easy to set expire date for obfuscated scripts by :option:`-e`. For
example, generate obfuscated script with the expire date to 30 days::

    $ pyarmor gen -O dist4 -e 30 foo.py

Run the obfuscated scripts :file:`dist4/foo.py` to verify it::

    $ python dist4/foo.py

It checks network time, make sure your machine is connected to internet.

Let's use another form to set past date ``2020-12-31``::

    $ pyarmor gen -O dist4 -e 2020-12-31 foo.py

Now :file:`dist4/foo.py` should not work::

    $ python dist4/foo.py

If expire date has a leading ``.``, it will check local time other than
NTP_ server. For examples::

    $ pyarmor gen -O dist4 -e .30 foo.py
    $ pyarmor gen -O dist4 -e .2020-12-31 foo.py

For this form internet connection is not required in target machine.

Distributing the expired script is same as above, copy the whole directory
:file:`dist4/` to target machine.

Binding obfuscated scripts to device
====================================

Suppose got target machine hardware informations::

    IPv4:                        128.16.4.10
    Enternet Addr:               00:16:3e:35:19:3d
    Hard Disk Serial Number:     HXS2000CN2A

Using :option:`-e` to bind hardware information to obfuscated scripts. For
example, bind :file:`dist5/foo.py` to enternet address::

    $ pyarmor gen -O dist5 -b 00:16:3e:35:19:3d foo.py

So :file:`dist5/foo.py` only could run in target machine.

It's same to bind IPv4 and serial number of hard disk::

    $ pyarmor gen -O dist5 -b 128.16.4.10 foo.py
    $ pyarmor gen -O dist5 -b HXS2000CN2A foo.py

It's possible to combine some of them. For example::

    $ pyarmor gen -O dist5 -b "00:16:3e:35:19:3d HXS2000CN2A" foo.py

Only both enternet address and hard disk are matched machine could run this
obfuscated script.

Distributing scripts bind to device is same as above, copy the whole
directory :file:`dist5/` to target machine.

Packaging obfuscated scripts
============================

Remeber again, the obfuscated script is normal Python script, use it as
it's not obfuscated.

Suppose package ``mypkg`` structure like this::

    projects/
    └── src/
        └── mypkg/
            ├── __init__.py
            ├── utils.py
            └── config.json

First make output path :file:`projects/dist6` for obfuscated package::

    $ cd projects
    $ mkdir dist6

Then copy package data files to output path::

    $ cp -a src/mypkg dist6/

Next obfuscate scripts to overwrite all the ``.py`` files in
:file:`dist6/mypkg`::

    $ pyarmor gen -O dist6 -i src/mypkg

The final output::

    projects/
    ├── README.md
    └── src/
        └── mypkg/
            ├── __init__.py
            ├── utils.py
            └── config.json
    └── dist6/
        └── mypkg/
            ├── __init__.py
            ├── utils.py
            ├── config.json
            └── pyarmor_runtime_000000/__init__.py

Comparing with :file:`src/mypkg`, the only difference is :file:`dist6/mypkg`
has an extra sub-package ``pyarmor_runtime_000000``. The last thing is
packaging :file:`dist6/mypkg` as your prefer way.

New to Python packaging? Refer to `Python Packaging User Guide`_

.. _Python Packaging User Guide: https://packaging.python.org

Something need to know
======================

There is binary `extension module`_ :mod:`pyarmor_runtime` in extra
sub-package ``pyarmor_runtime_000000``, here it's package content::

    $ ls dist6/mypkg/pyarmor_runtime_000000
    ...    __init__.py
    ...    pyarmor_runtime.so

Generally using binary extensions means the obfuscated scripts require
:mod:`pyarmor_runtime` be created for different platforms, so they

* only works for platforms which provides pre-built binaries
* may not be compatible with different builds of CPython interpreter
* often will not work correctly with alternative interpreters such as PyPy,
  IronPython or Jython

For example, when obfuscating scripts by Python 3.8, they can't be run by
Python 3.7, 3.9 etc.

Another disadvantage of relying on binary extensions is that alternative
import mechanisms (such as the ability to import modules directly from
zipfiles) often won't work for extension modules (as the dynamic loading
mechanisms on most platforms can only load libraries from disk).

What to read next
=================

There is a complete :doc:`installation <installation>` guide that
covers all the possibilities:

* install pyarmor by source
* call pyarmor from Python script
* clean uninstallation

Next is :doc:`obfuscation`. It covers

* using more option to obfuscate script and package
* using outer file to store runtime key
* localizing runtime error messages
* packing obfuscated scripts and protect system packages

And then :doc:`advanced`, some of them are not available in trial pyarmor

* changing Pyarmor default behaviours by :ref:`pyarmor cfg`
* plugin and hooks
* cross platform, multiple platforms and multiple Python version
* runtime error internationalization
* 2 irreversible obfuscation: RFT mode, BCC mode :sup:`pyarmor-pro`

Also you may be instersting in this guide :doc:`../how-to/security`

How the documentation is organized
==================================

|Pyarmor| has a lot of documentation. A high-level overview of how it's
organized will help you know where to look for certain things:

* :doc:`Part 1: Tutorials <../part-1>` now you're reading.

* :doc:`Part 2: How To <../part-2>` guides are recipes. They guide you through
  the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more
  advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how |Python| works.

* :doc:`Part 3: References <../part-3>` guides contain key concepts, man page,
  configurations and other aspects of |Pyarmor| machinery.

* :doc:`Part 4: Topics <../part-4>` guides insight into key topics and provide
  useful background information and explanation. They describe how it works and
  how to use it but assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.

* :doc:`Part 5: Licneses <../licenses>` describes EULA of |Pyarmor|, the different
  |Pyarmor| licenses and how to purchase |Pyarmor| license.
