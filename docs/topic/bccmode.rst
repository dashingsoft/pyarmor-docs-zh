深入了解 BCC 模式
=================

.. highlight:: console

.. program:: pyarmor gen

BCC mode could convert most of functions and methods in the scripts to equivalent C functions, those c functions will be comipled to machine instructions directly, then called by obfuscated scripts.

It requires ``c`` compiler. In Linux and Darwin, ``gcc`` and ``clang`` is OK. In Windows, only ``clang.exe`` works. It could be configured by one of these ways:

* If there is any ``clang.exe``, it's OK if it could be run in other path.
* Download and install Windows version of `LLVM <https://releases.llvm.org>`_
* Download `https://pyarmor.dashingsoft.com/downloads/tools/clang-9.0.zip`, it's about 26M bytes, there is only one file in it. Unzip it and save ``clang.exe`` to ``$HOME/.pyarmor/``. ``$HOME`` is home path of current logon user, check the environment variable ``HOME`` to get the real path.

Enable BCC mode
===============

After compiler works, using :option:`--enable-bcc` to enable BCC mode::

    $ pyarmor gen --enable-bcc foo.py

All the source in module level is not converted to C function.

Trace bcc log
=============

To check which functions are converted to C function, enable trace mode before obfuscate the script::

    $ pyarmor cfg enable_trace=1
    $ pyarmor gen --enable-bcc foo.py

Then check the trace log::

    $ ls .pyarmor/pyarmor.trace.log
    $ grep trace.bcc .pyarmor/pyarmor.trace.log

    trace.bcc            foo:5:hello
    trace.bcc            foo:9:sum2
    trace.bcc            foo:12:main

The first log means ``foo.py`` line 5 function ``hello`` is protected by bcc.
The second log means ``foo.py`` line 9 function ``sum2`` is protected by bcc.

Ignore module or function
=========================

When BCC scripts reports errors, a quick workaround is to ignore these problem modules or functions. Because BCC mode converts some functions to C code, these funtions are not compatiable with Python function object. They may not be called by outer Python scripts, and can't be fixed in Pyarmor side. In this case use configuration option ``bcc:excludes`` and ``bcc:disabled`` to ignore function or module, and make all the others work.

First enable debug mode by common option ``-d``::

    $ pyarmor -d gen --enable-bcc foo.py

Check trace log to find which functions are converted to c function. If there are problem functions, then tell BCC mode does not deal with it. For example, ignore function ``sum2`` in the module ``foo.py`` by this command::

    $ pyarmor cfg -p foo bcc:excludes="sum2"

Use ``-p`` to specify module name and option ``bcc:excludes`` for function name. No ``-p``, same name function in the other scripts will be ignored too.

Append more functions to exclude by this way::

    $ pyarmor cfg -p foo bcc:excludes + "hello foo2"

Then obfuscate the script again::

    $ pyarmor gen --enable-bcc /path/to/pkg/joker
    $ python dist/foo.py

When obfuscating package, it also could exclude one module separately. For example, in the following commands BCC mode ignores ``joker/card.py``, but handle all the other scripts in package ``joker``::

    $ pyarmor cfg -p joker.card bcc:disabled=1
    $ pyarmor gen --enable-bcc /path/to/pkg/joker

By both of ``bcc:excludes`` and ``bcc:disable``, make all the problem code fallback to default obfuscation mode, and let others could be converted to c function and work fine.

Changed features
================

Here are some changed features in the BCC mode:

* Calling `raise` without argument not in the exception handler will raise different exception.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> raise
    RuntimeError: No active exception to reraise

    # In BCC mode
    >>> raise
    UnboundlocalError: local variable referenced before assignment

* Some exception messages may different from the plain script.

* Most of function attributes which starts with ``__`` doesn't exists, or the value is different from the original.

Unsupport features
==================

If a function uses any unsupoported features, it could not be converted into C code.

Here list unsupport features for BCC mode:

.. code-block:: python

    unsupport_nodes = (
        ast.ExtSlice,

        ast.AsyncFunctionDef, ast.AsyncFor, ast.AsyncWith,
        ast.Await, ast.Yield, ast.YieldFrom, ast.GeneratorExp,

        ast.NamedExpr,

        ast.MatchValue, ast.MatchSingleton, ast.MatchSequence,
        ast.MatchMapping, ast.MatchClass, ast.MatchStar,
        ast.MatchAs, ast.MatchOr
    )

And unsupport functions:

* exec
* eval
* super
* locals
* sys._getframe
* sys.exc_info

For example, the following functions are not obfuscated by BCC mode, because they use unsupported features or unsupported functions:

.. code-block:: python

   async def nested():
       return 42

   def foo1():
       for n range(10):
           yield n

   def foo2():
      frame = sys._getframe(2)
      print('parent frame is', frame)

.. include:: ../_common_definitions.txt
