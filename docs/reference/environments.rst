* private: each module ``foo`` may has one ini file either
  :file:`~/.pyarmor/foo.rules` or :file:`.pyarmor/foo.rules`

Target Device
=============

Target device is to run the obfuscated scripts.

Support platforms, arches and Python versions are same as `Building device`_

:attr:`sys._MEIPASS`

      Borrowed from PyInstaller_, set search path for :term:`outer key`.

:attr:`sys._PARLANG`

      It's used to set language for runtime error message.

      If it's set, :envvar:`LANG` is ignored.

.. envvar:: LANG

            OS environment variable, used to select language for runtime error
            message.

.. envvar:: PYARMOR_LANG

            It's used to set language for runtime error message.

            If it's set, both :envvar:`LANG` and :attr:`sys._PARLANG` are ignored.
